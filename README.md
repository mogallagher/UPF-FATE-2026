# UPF-FATE-2025/2026

Instructor: [Ashwin Singh](https://rashomonset.github.io)

Repository containing programming practices for final-year undergraduate students of *Data Science* and *Computer Engineering*, enrolled in the *Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics (FATE)* Course at **Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona**. Visit the [Course Website](https://sites.google.com/view/upf-fate) for more information.

## Objective of the Sessions

### I. Data Anonymization
*   Code Satisfiability of Anonymity Criteria ($k$-Anonymity, $l$-Diversity, $t$-Closeness).
*   Implement Perturbative & Non-Perturbative Methods for satisfying Anonymity Criteria.
*   Understand Trade-Offs in Anonymization and Limitations of different Anonymity Criteria.

### II. Algorithmic Fairness: Regression

*   Understand Bias Propagation in Regression as a consequence of Omitting Sensitive Variables.
*   Implement Fairness Criteria for Regression (Counterfactual Fairness & Demographic Parity).
*   Work through Case Studies to adapt Fairness Criteria to real-world scenarios.

### III. Algorithmic Fairness: Classification
*   Recap of Confusion Matrices, Receiver Operating Characteristic and Error Detection Curves. 
*   Implement different Pre/In/Post-Processing methods using [AIF360](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360) to improve Model Fairness.
*   Work on a Project, from Discrimination-Discovery to Mitigation of Disparate Impact; **Bonus**:
    *   *Model Explanaibility using Counterfactuals, LIME & SHAP.*
    *   *Ablation on Feature Subsets for improved Model Fairness.*
    *   *Effect of* $k$-*Anonymization on Model Fairness*.
